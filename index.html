        My name is Alexander Griep but you can call me Alex. I am a nerd and proud of it. I believe that we all should be who we are and like what we like. And if you don't like what I like and I don't like what you like, there should be no problems between us.

        I was born in Burnsville, MN on October 15th, 1987. I grew up in St. Anthony, MN, a small suburb in NE Minneapolis, where I went to school from K to 12. From there, I went to the University of Minnesota - Morris to obtain my BS in English.

        After graduating from college, I traveled to China (Jiangmen and Jilin) to teach Oral English at the university level to Chinese students. After returning to the USA, I had a couple jobs for short periods of time until I landed on Medica for 1.5 years. After hiring way too many people to work in my department, I was let go and finally landed on Target Corporation as a Sr. Collections Specialist, where I work today.
